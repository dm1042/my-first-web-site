<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>
  JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images
and other objects, such as interactive
forms, may be embedded into the rendered
page. It provides a means to create
structured documents by denoting
structural semantics for text such as
headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
quotes and other items, HTML elements
are delineated by tags, written using
angle brackets.
